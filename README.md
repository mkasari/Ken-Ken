# Ken-Ken
Group Project for COMP 560. 
Completed with Andrew Jacober and Sarah Hand.

The code has been provided in python, and can be run in terminal or powershell depending on what OS you are using.

The code requires an additional input of a filename with extention .txt in order to run correctly.

An example might be: python COMP560_A1.py filename.txt

The file should be in the format of the example input given in the COMP560 A1 assignment description

Please give the script enough time to run, it can be very slow at times as some functions depend on random values and can vary in completion time due to this. Also, it is not the most efficient implementation so it may take longer than desired to complete larger puzzle sizes.
